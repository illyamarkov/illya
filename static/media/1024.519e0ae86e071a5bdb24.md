What is 1024? Who is... 1024? ... When... is 1024? Okay, so, this was basically a joke project which nobody really got. Some people took it super seriously, but it was a kind of "anti-art" gallery. It features exactly 1024 images of stones that are each 1024x1024 pixels. Not only that, each stone is in black and white, and has 1024 maximum shades.

All the stones are also generated by Stable Diffusion, just to add to the distancing of ones creativity... and because it's kinda funny.

What's cool is that **all** stones are stored on the [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), and this was the first project I have ever done utilizing a decentralized system. One problem I had was to come up with a way to store all files despite the provider I used to pin the images limiting the amount of files I could upload:

In essence, I uploaded them as 16 image zip chunks, totaling 64, then kept a "list" of the location of every chunk on the IPFS DHT.

## Pros
- Implementation of IPFS and ZIP technology on a purely VanillaJS website.
- Cool?

## Cons
- Slow.
- Images aren't lazy loaded. They are all loaded in full 1024x1024.

## Status
Finished!
