# About

Welcome to my *blortfolio*! I post my projects here and may blog about the creation of new projects as they are happening. 

* You can select the projects on the left (or click on their corresponding planets)! 
* Scroll (or swipe up and down) on the planets to zoom in and out! 
* Click the eye to open and close the projects for more room to read!

### *Blortfolio*?

A blortfolio is a portmanteau of blog and portfolio. I considered making a typical portfolio website, but I am always so disinterested when I see anyone's personal site with how little there is to look at. It's usually just a collection of projects; no history of development, no inside peek into how they work or what challenges they had to overcome, just a static site with some basic Three.js stuff to dazzle employers with no experience in web development. This aims to change that while offering an archive of my projects! 

### What if I just want to quickly read it over?

There is a *TL;DR* section at the top of every project which quickly summarizes what its about, and there is usually something at the bottom to quickly view features or project information.

## Why?

I make a bunch of projects and a lot of them go completely undocumented. For example: much of my software exists on slowly dying hard drives never to reach any sort of public space. Lots of my hardware projects are only developed to completion, and once that happens, are scavenged for parts immediately. Almost all my work will probably never get seen by anyone beyond some bots scraping random web pages, or someone who just so happens to talk to me while I'm still working on a given project. With this site, all my projects are in one convenient space!

I have made a very simple way for me to add projects to this site with an interesting layout and a quick way for others to see what I'm working on. Watch out for new changes as I also plan to:

* Add moons for "subprojects" of a given project
* Have satellites orbiting each planet which will show you how many people are following that project (and allow you to follow it as well)
* Maybe even allow many star systems for other devs to show off the projects they are working on!

There will likely be **many** planets in the Illya star system, most of which will be websites or software, as I have other plans for hardware stuff.

<p style="font-style: italic;">P.S. This is the first project I did in React! My takeaway? Suuuuper bloated. 1.5k packages: ~300MB just to start a project? Very easy, but yucky under the hood. Eh, good for quickly making pretty sites, I guess. PERFECT for webdev dopamine junkies or folks who only care about money!</p>
