# Grow

This website was an early project I did while studying at the University of Toronto! It was basically a plant (named Greg) that I put alongside a QR code leading to the website for it. Anyone who walked by could scan the code and indicate if they watered the plant, allowing a "crowd sourcing" to keep Greg alive! Everything was going so well, but... some *scoundrel*, an absolute ***RAPSCALLION*** stole Greg... and so it came to end.

| *Greg... forever in our hearts.* |

The point of the project was to eventually expand it to handle every plant on campus, and allow students to easily check if a plant needed to be watered. Students could also request the addition of plants they bring to the school, encouraging a more greener environment.

## Features
- Allows students to comment (automatically added to a Google Form which I can manually approve in the Google Spreadsheet) and even show a picture with Greg using an Imgur API "buffer."
- Written in VanillaJS, so very lightweight while still modern looking.
- Promotes cooperation and environmentalism!

## Status
Development terminated. Will potentially resume with adequate support.
